### An attacker need obtain user account information before exploiting this vulnerability

# Affected devices

| Version  |      Software     |  Firmware |
| B2368-57 |  B2368_V100R001C00SPC114 | 11.620.XX.XX.XX |


# Sumary
SSRF to RCE issues are found in B2368-57 changing the default endpoint to a false one and bypassing software validation check, injecting os command, because __use directly wget__ OS command, to obtain a new firmware.

## First
 you must change the default endpoint to a fake one.

## Remote fake endpoint
In this case is possible show the full domain and port used for the *ISP*.

You can bypass url with # and change wrapper http:// to ftp://

## RCE

Is possible bypass the sanity check in Wget command.
Yes! is possible
you need mount a fake endpoint, in this case im use flask to host the payload with os command.

### Then

you must accept and download the fake firmware.

### Got RCE!
you can execute OS command.

### How this work?

After accepting the malicious firmware download, the basic software package file __validity check be bypassed__ and __inject command__ to execute in the B2368-57 device.

## Impact

+ Successful exploit of the vulnerability will cause the target device be controlled.
